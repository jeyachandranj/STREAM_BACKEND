# stream

"This project streams backend APIs while generating random dummy data, which is then pushed to Kafka using Spring Boot. The backend is designed to handle real-time data processing, ensuring seamless integration with the front-end dashboard."

1. **CUSTOMER_ORDER_FOOD**: Represents the event when a customer places an order for food.
2. **DRIVER_ACCEPT**: Represents the event when a driver accepts the order for delivery.
3. **PICK_UP_FROM_RESTAURANT**: Represents the event when the driver picks up the order from the restaurant.
4. **DROP_OFF_TO_CUSTOMER**: Represents the event when the driver delivers the food to the customer.
5. **CUSTOMER_REJECT**: Represents the event when the customer rejects the delivered food.

These events are part of the data flow in the project, driving the state changes in the food delivery process.
